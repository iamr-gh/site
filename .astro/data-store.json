As I do so, these are some guiding principles for how I write software going forward. \n\n## Properties of Software\n\n### Simplicity and Organization\n\nLess code is better, but not at the expense of clarity. Brevity matters, but simplicity comes first. When a cleaner solution exists, use it.\n\nCode should be descriptive and organized across reasonably-sized, well-named files. Avoid both excessive fragmentation and monolithic files. If forced to choose, prefer the latter. Both practices proactively reduce technical debt as projects scale.\n\n### Performance\n\nModern compilers and hardware are extraordinarily capable. Noticeable lag demands justification.\n\nFor most websites and CLI tools, content should load instantly. Performance isn't about specific language choices; it's about refusing to accept unnecessary slowness. Computational heavy lifting (machine learning, graphics rendering) earns a pass, but everything else should be as responsive as possible.\n\n### Portability\n\nCross-platform software is ideal. The web is the most universal platform, but supporting multiple operating systems suffices. This starts with choosing cross-platform toolchains from day one. On this site, I will deploy tools targeting WebAssembly or JavaScript.\n\nNon-cross-platform software needs clear toolchain justification. I don't do mobile or native development, so these restrictions rarely concern me.\n\n### AI Usage\n\nAI assistance should be invisible. When used, output must meet human quality standards—this applies to writing and code equally.\n\nAI accelerates work; it doesn't excuse laziness. The standard should be **AI-generated, human-verified** for any tool in this space.\n\n## Properties of Development\n\n### Rapid Initial Prototyping\n\nComplex projects need achievable checkpoints. Reaching the first checkpoint quickly is critical—it prevents wasted effort and surfaces hard problems early.\n\n### Incremental Debugging\n\nWhen progress stalls, decompose the blocker into manageable pieces. AI helps break through obstacles with fresh perspective. Projects demanding intense mental engagement are vulnerable to motivation loss and abandonment-consistent, incremental progress is the antidote.","src/content/blog/better-software.md","3105e9c79369d130",{"html":24,"metadata":25},"\u003C!--I once had something more profound for this, but I don't recall anymore-->\n\u003C!-- and some point, should have some piece about tools-->\n\u003Ch1 id=\"better-software-faster\">Better Software, Faster\u003C/h1>\n\u003Cp>I’ve created a \u003Ca href=\"/blog/why\">personal site\u003C/a> to showcase and document my projects.
