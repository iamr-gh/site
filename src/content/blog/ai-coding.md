# Experiments with AI Coding

AI coding has become substantially better in the last 6 months. I don't use AI coding much in my workflows, beyond auto complete. In this blog post, I evaluate how useful these tools are at solving my problems. This is not with respect to any benchmark other than my personal real life usage.

Personally, I primarily use neovim+tmux as my editor setup, preferring to be closer to the terminal. A lot of the popular tools(e.g. Cursor) are based on VSCode-style workflows, which often feel inelegant to me. This does not stop me from using these tools, but I don't find them as useful because I feel an inherent slowdown that contrasts whatever ai benefits I get.

As such, I am actively looking for more terminal-native ai-coding tools and ways to integrate into my existing neovim workflows.
