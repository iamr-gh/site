# Better Software, Faster

I have recently started a [new blog](/hello-world), as a place to showcase and store various projects of mine. As such, I am starting with my goals for all software I write.

## Portability

## Performance
Modern compilers and hardware are very fast. If anything does not load instantly, there should be a good justification for why.

Things that should be fast(instantaneous) and responsive:
- website content
- cli tools

Things that can be slow:
- Machine learning tasks
- Intensive live graphics
- Complex tasks

## AI Usage
My standard for all AI usage is it should not be noticable. 
If AI is used on a project, it should be up to basic humans standards. 
This is most notable in writing, but applies to code as well.
