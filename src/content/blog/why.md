# My Site


This is my third iteration of a personal site, after abandoning the last attempt two years ago. I'm not passionate about front-end development. I much prefer writing machine learning, systems, and compiler code.

So why bring it back now?

## Other Sites

Many platforms already host the information that typically ends up on a personal site.

**GitHub** is perfect for showcasing side projects, providing the exact code and instructions for users to clone and run it. However, it's not ideal for explanations or live demos.

**LinkedIn** contains my full work history and education, but the platform's focus on "professional" social interactions leaves little room for technical, personal, or authentic content.

**Medium/Substack** make it easy to write blog posts with built-in formatting, discoverability, and monetization tools. However, they lack customizability for complex interactive features.

## Unique Value of a Personal Site


Hosting my own site provides a centralized place for information that other platforms don't capture well. Since I already have LinkedIn and GitHub accounts, information that belongs there will stay there. This site isn't a recruiting portfolio, it's a useful collection of resources and project explanations.

### Blog

Posts here will vary. Some will be high-level philosophy pieces like this one, others deeply technical. I'm inspired by interactive art experiences and want to use my site's flexibility to create them. I already have basic tools like syntax highlighting:

### Demos and Tools

This site will host tools I create. I already have a rudimentary QR code generator, and plan to deploy more projects as they become useful. I'm excited to experiment with WebAssembly to make my native code projects more easily deployable online.
